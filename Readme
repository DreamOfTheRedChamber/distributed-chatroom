This directory includes the Spread toolkit, its monitor (called spmonitor)
and the sample user (spuser).

The directory also includes a sample spread.conf file - configuring
Spread. You HAVE to change the multicast address and the spread port
(currently the multicast address is 226.1.2.3 and port 4813).
